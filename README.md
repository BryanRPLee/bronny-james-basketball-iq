# Bronny James Basketball IQ

This project is a stepping stone for me in my data science journey through the exploratory analysis of sports, specifically the NBA.

This project was initially aimed to give me insight into how brainless Bronny James is on the basketball court and (surprise) his results were quite bad. However, the goal for this notebook became a lot more instructive when I started comparing him to the smartest players in the league.

I based this project on a guesstimate of CraftedNBA's Basketball IQ metric through the use of adjusted box-plus minus in addition to box score and advance statistics, which does not take into account multiple year performances like how models like RAPTOR, LEBRON, and DARKO normally work but instead just uses data from the NBA, ESPN, and RAPM sites from the first 16 games of the season. This may cause some _obvious_ discrepancies such as Coby White displayed as smarter than Nikola Jokic (which is objectively false) and Jimmy Butler not even making the top 20, but through hindsight, my results are _mostly_ correct.
